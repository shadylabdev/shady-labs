# Introduction

Shady Labs is the **privacy layer for Solana** — enabling stealth transactions, encryption, and zero-knowledge authentication.

It allows users to send and receive crypto **without ever revealing their real wallet address.**
Each transaction generates a **one-time stealth address**, encrypts data locally, and publishes only unreadable ciphertext to the blockchain.

Shady empowers builders, traders, and users who value **true on-chain anonymity** without sacrificing Solana’s speed or efficiency.
