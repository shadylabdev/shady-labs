> The privacy layer for Solana — stealth transactions, encryption, and zk-Gate access.

Shady Labs brings **real privacy** to Solana.  
Every transaction uses **one-time stealth addresses**, client-side encryption, and optional zk-proofs — keeping your data secure without slowing down speed.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧩 **Stealth Addresses** — One-time addresses for every transaction.  
- 🔐 **Local Encryption** — Transactions encrypted on your device, not on-chain.  
- 🕵️ **Anonymous Transfers** — Send and receive privately on Solana.  
- ⚙️ **zk-Gate Access** — Zero-knowledge authentication for private dApps.  
- 💻 **Developer SDK** — Easy integration for wallets, dApps, and protocols.

## ⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Receiver generates a **Meta Key** (View + Spend Key).  
2️⃣ Sender uses it to create a **unique stealth address**.  
3️⃣ Transaction details are **encrypted** locally and sent on-chain.  
4️⃣ Receiver scans and decrypts using the **View Key**.  
5️⃣ Receiver claims funds using the **Spend Key** — address self-destructs.

Each transfer = a new address = no trace, no link, full privacy.

## 🧠 Vision
Shady Labs aims to make **privacy the default** on Solana —  
allowing users, builders, and protocols to interact **securely, anonymously, and transparently** through cryptography, not trust.
